    "\n",
    "## Those not born during WWI and WWII\n",
    "The grooves of those not born due to soldiers at war, and the corresponding peaks from home comings carve through the ageing peaks\n",
    "\n",
    "## How dangerous the first year of life used to be\n",
    "The first year of life is still much more dangerous than the following decades, but it used to be much worse and was until the early '70s the most dangerous age to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The slight uptick of risk for adolescents and early adulthood\n",
    "\n",
    "## Although middle ages has got considerably safer, life has not extended\n",
    "The trailing edge of the curve gets increasingly steep. Unfortunately for many, much of the extension is much more about living with poor health conditions, rather than enjoying later life.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Averages can be misleading\n",
    "Taking the early annual snapshots, especially, illustrates how misleading 'life expectancy' for a population can be. Although it's not easy to trace the actual age at death for any give cohort - there aren't enough years covered to do this - a good approximation can be deduced by slicing along a year. This exercise illustrates how it is possible for the expected life span for a given group to be skewed by infant death in particular, and early deaths in general."
